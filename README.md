# Community ReasonML/BuckleScript RFCs

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and it would be incredibly useful to put
them through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the
ReasonML/BuckleScript community and the development teams.

Hence us starting this repository, in the hopes that we can grow the platform
and language together, with a lightweight process that can guide us along the
way.

> Note: if this process gains traction, we will make sure that this repository
> includes clearer guidelines for creating RFCs and what the process exactly
> entails.
